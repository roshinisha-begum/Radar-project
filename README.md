# Radar-project
This radar project uses an Arduino with an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor to scan and detect objects. The distance data is sent to Processing software for real-time radar-style visualization. It demonstrates Arduino-based sensor interfacing, motor control, and graphical output.
